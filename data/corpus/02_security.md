# Security & Compliance

SentinelIQ enforces:
1. Role-based access controls with least-privilege defaults.
2. Continuous monitoring for prompt injections and data exfiltration attempts.
3. Inline toxicity detection that blocks disallowed content above a configurable threshold.

Security posture highlights:
- SOC 2 Type II controls validated annually.
- FedRAMP moderate alignment through our hosting partners.
- All retrieval contexts are filtered for PII before indexing.

Customers can export guardrail audit logs for compliance evidence.
